# Poetry recomender

This project is a RAG that recommends poems based on the user prompt.

The LLM used is Mistral AI (free version since this is only a school project and will be soon consigned to oblivion).

The dataset comes from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelarman/poemsdataset).

You may install this libraries before running it:

```txt
pip install mistralai, numpy, sklearn
```
